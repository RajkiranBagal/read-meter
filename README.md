Read Meter - readme 

This plugin displays estimated reading time for blog posts along with a progress bar. It works great to give visitors a quick idea of time needed to read the post and will encourage them to go till the end of the post 

Usually, visitors try to scan the entire post at first glance and grasp as much as information possible from the post. Reading time specified in minutes motivates users to read the post. 

A handy progress bar will show the reader’s position on the post. As soon as the reader scrolls the page, the progress bar will indicate the remaining part of the post. 

The plugin uses an advanced image time calculation technique. In case your post contains images, the plugin calculates the time to view those images as well. It adds 12 seconds for the first image, 11 seconds for the second image and so on till the 10th image. After that, it adds 3 seconds for each further image.

FAQ 

Where can I find settings?
After installing and activating the plugin, settings can be found under Settings > Read Meter 

How read time is calculated?
Let’s assume, you have set Words Per Minute ( Settings > Read Meter > General Settings) to 275 and total words in your blog post are 1100. So the total number of words (1100) divided by Words per minute (275) will give you estimated time of reading i.e. 4 minutes.
